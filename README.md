Implementation of AnimateDiff
https://github.com/guoyww/AnimateDiff

This deployment uses a serverless, container-based approach.

Example usage:
python -m scripts.animate --config configs/prompts/1_animate/1_1_animate_RealisticVision.yaml

High-level overview
Goal: Turn any Stable Diffusion v1.5 image model into a text-to-video generator by adding a plug-and-play temporal “motion module,” with optional extra controls (SparseCtrl, MotionLoRA, DreamBooth/LoRA).

Core components

UNet3DConditionModel (animatediff/models/unet.py): Starts from SD’s 2D UNet weights and “inflates” them to 3D (adds a time dimension). It inserts temporal transformer blocks (the “motion module”) at chosen resolutions so features attend across frames.
Motion module (animatediff/models/motion_module.py): Temporal attention layers (VanillaTemporalModule) that perform attention along the time axis, learning transferable motion priors. Motion LoRA can adapt specific motion styles (zoom, pan, tilt, roll).
Animation pipeline (animatediff/pipelines/pipeline_animation.py): A Diffusers-style pipeline that:
Encodes prompts with CLIP,
Denoises 3D latents with the 3D UNet + motion module over a scheduler’s timesteps,
Optionally applies SparseCtrl conditioning residuals,
Decodes frames with the VAE and returns a video tensor.
SparseCtrl (animatediff/models/sparse_controlnet.py): A ControlNet-like conditioning branch for sparse inputs (few RGB images or sketches). It encodes sparse conditions, produces per-block residuals, and injects them into the UNet’s down/mid blocks to steer content across frames.
Utilities (animatediff/utils/util.py):
load_weights pulls in motion module checkpoints (only motion_modules.* keys), DreamBooth/LoRA/Adapter LoRA layers, and Motion LoRA; auto-downloads from Hugging Face when needed.
save_videos_grid writes GIFs; decoding runs frame-by-frame to reduce VRAM.
Scripts:
scripts/animate.py: CLI entrypoint. Loads configs, builds tokenizer/CLIP/vae/UNet3D, optionally attaches SparseCtrl, loads weights, runs sampling, saves GIFs.
app.py: Gradio UI for interactive use.
train.py: Training code (not needed for inference).
Runtime flow (inference)

Read a YAML config listing prompts and model knobs (image size, length, steps, guidance, optional checkpoints).
Load SD v1.5 components (tokenizer, CLIP text encoder, VAE) and create a 3D UNet from 2D weights.
Optional: build a SparseControlNetModel from the UNet config, load its checkpoint, and prepare control images.
Enable memory-efficient attention (xFormers) if available.
Assemble AnimationPipeline with scheduler (e.g., DDIM), then call load_weights to inject:
Motion module checkpoint into the UNet (temporal blocks),
Domain Adapter LoRA, DreamBooth base, and LoRA layers as requested,
Motion LoRA(s) for specific motion patterns.
For each prompt:
Encode text (with optional negative prompt, for classifier-free guidance),
Sample 3D latents over T timesteps; at each step, UNet predicts noise, optionally guided by SparseCtrl residuals,
Decode latents to frames with VAE; save as GIF.
Configuration-driven

YAMLs in configs/ define prompts, seeds, dimensions, scheduler/unet extra kwargs, and paths for motion modules, LoRAs, and control inputs.
What makes it “plug-and-play”

Temporal attention is added around the pretrained 2D UNet without retraining the image model; motion priors are loaded from separate checkpoints and can be adapted via lightweight LoRAs. This preserves image model “style” while adding motion.
Typical usage

CLI: python -m scripts.animate --config <a config yaml>
App: python -u app.py launches a Gradio demo.
Dependencies

Hugging Face Diffusers/Transformers, PyTorch, xFormers (optional), OmegaConf for configs.
Notes

SDXL support exists on a separate branch (sdxl-beta).
Videos are decoded sequentially to limit VRAM.
Control inputs are broadcast along time using masks and indexes to align sparse frames with the generated sequence.
Where to look for specifics

Sampling loop: scripts/animate.py constructs and runs the pipeline.
Denoising steps and ControlNet injection: animatediff/pipelines/pipeline_animation.py::__call__.
Temporal attention details: animatediff/models/motion_module.py.
Weight loading/injection logic: animatediff/utils/util.py::load_weights.
